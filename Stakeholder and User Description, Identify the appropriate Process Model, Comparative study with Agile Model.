Stakeholder and User Description, Identify the appropriate Process Model, Comparative study with Agile Model.

Problem Description: (Process Step)

A)	Stakeholder and itâ€™s categories: -

Meaning of Stakeholder: -  A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a company  and can  either affect or be affected by the business.

It is categorized into two parts: -

i)	Internal Stakeholder: - Investors are internal stakeholders who are significantly impacted by the associated concern and its performance. Internal stakeholders are people whose interest in a company comes through a direct relationship, such as employment, ownership, or investment.

ii)	External Stakeholder: - External stakeholders do not have a direct relationship with the company. External stakeholders are those who do not directly work with a company but are affected somehow by the actions and outcomes of the business. Suppliers, creditors, and public groups.

ii) External Stakeholders are    Associations Trade and industry associations, Customers, Freelancers, Investors, Merchants, Miners, Mining Hardware providers, Mining Pools, Tax regulators, Traders, Government Treasuries.


2. Waterfall Model: -

Introduction: -

This model is also known as linear-sequential life cycle model. The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced.  It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in any phases. It illustrates the
software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.

Waterfall Model	                                                                                  Agile Model
1-	Waterfall helps complete one single project.	                                                1-Agile helps complete many small projects.
2-	Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach.	                                              2-Agile is an incremental and iterative approach.
3-	Waterfall divides a project into phases.	                                                    3-Agile separates a project into sprints.
4-	Waterfall avoids scope changes once the project starts.                                      	4-Agile allows requirement changes at any time.
5-	Waterfall requires a project manager who plays an essential role in every phase.	            5-Agile enables the entire team to manage the project without a dedicated project manager.
6-	Requirements are prepared once at the start in Waterfall.	                                    6-Requirements are prepared every day in Agile.
7-	Testing phase comes only after the build phase in Waterfall.	                                7-Testing is performed concurrently with development in Agile.
