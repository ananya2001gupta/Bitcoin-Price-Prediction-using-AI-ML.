Prepare the work- Breakdown Structure based on timelines, Risk Identification and Plan.
Problem Description: 
Breakdown Structure based on timelines:- 
Risk Identification and Plan:-
Definition of Risk Identification -->   Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the program, enterprise, or investment from achieving its objectives. It includes documenting and communicating the concern.
There are some Risks and how to manage them in this project :-
a) Traditional Methods are unable to capture non-linear patterns .
b)Machine learning methods may be unable capturing very complicated patterns.
c) MAE, RMSE and Accuracy are not efficient enough. - Let assume a test of 100 questions.
Model A answers 60 correct questions; Score A = 60/100.
Model B selects to answer only 9 questions while it answers all correctly; Score B = 9/100.
Which model is better?
➢ A cryptocurrency investor probably would choose Model B even if its accuracy score is too
low.
➢ A proper validation must emphasize on investor profits.
➢ Thus, the invention of new alternative evaluation
methods is essential.New evaluation metrics should be invented
d) The change in volatility, f1−4 is an important indicator. It is a measure of the uncertainty and is
used to reflect the risk level of Bitcoin price. The larger the value of f1−4 is, the stronger the signals
are. Formally, the change in volatility between current period (cur) and previous period (pre)
e) . Data Normalization
We need to normalize inputs in neural networks and other data mining models, otherwise, the
network will perform poorly.
method:- Normalization here uses the MinMaxScalar Package, after normalization, data is plotted using
matplot libraries and the trend is seen to check the fluctuations in the price and volume of the bitcoin
over the last 2 years (2017-2018).
f)Budgetting :- To maintain this , we can use reuable software components .
